# Flocculator_Code
ðŸ§ª Arduino-Based RPM Control for Flocculator / Jar Test
This project contains an Arduino Nano-based code designed to control the RPM of motors, adjust test time, and display key data on an LCD screen for a flocculator (Jar Test) system used in water treatment processes. 

ðŸ”§ Features: 
- Precise RPM control using PWM for multiple stirrers.  
- Configurable test duration via buttons or potentiometer. 
- Real-time data display on a 16x2 LCD (speed, remaining time, etc.).  
- Optimized for Arduino Nano for compact and efficient integration.
